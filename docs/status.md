# Status and handoff

## Milestones

| Milestone | Needs the phone | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M2** toolchain: reproducible kernel pipeline (line K0) | no | **done**: CI run [43207707172](https://github.com/Homura8/g54-xnu/actions/runs/43207707172) reproduced ruby's kernel code and data (exec-data `6b22fc25…`) without any KDK, in 10 minutes |
| **M1** device facts and safety baseline | read-only first | not started; template in [device-facts.md](device-facts.md) |
| **M3** first observable execution: LK runs our code (panel colour), then XNU's early framebuffer mark | yes, with explicit approval | not started; depends on M1 + M2 |

Success criteria for M3, borrowed from ruby's proven ladder: (1) LK accepts
the image and a tiny payload paints the panel; (2) the kernel's stage-0 band
appears; (3) kernel log on screen. Each step is RAM-booted if the G54 permits
`fastboot boot`, photographed, and tied to the image hash.

## Why this route (decided 2026-11-12)

The fastest path to both first execution and a usable iOS is the direct
LK → XNU route proven on the MediaTek MT6877 by ruby-ios-bringup (iOS 16.7.16,
same kernel lineage as ios-qemu, the owner already has the IPSW). UniXNU's
iPadOS 17 route would first need a G54 UEFI port; no MediaTek UniXNU port has
reached a home screen. UniXNU stays the fallback if the G54's LK refuses
direct kernels.

## Next concrete steps

1. M1 read-only facts (owner, with the phone): fill device-facts.md. This is
   now the critical path; nothing device-specific can be written before it.
2. Boot-image format work once the header version and DTB location are known
   (ruby's `tools/image` covers header v2 only).
3. First G54 patch: the early framebuffer address/stride from M1, with the
   exec-data gate switched to record-only.

## K0 evidence (2026-11-12)

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Runner | `macos-15` image `20261104.0514.1`, macOS 15.8.2 (24H232) |
| Xcode | 16.0, build 16A242d (checked by the workflow) |
| KDK | none preinstalled; `KDKROOT` = empty directory, still empty after the build; no download |
| Patchsets | ruby `a9cc0050…` and G54 `a9cc0050…` (187 files) |
| Kernel | exec-data `6b22fc25…` = ruby CI 42301546006; `__TEXT`, `__CTF`, `__LINKEDIT` differ (build paths), all code and data segments identical |
| Time | 10 min with a cold ccache |
