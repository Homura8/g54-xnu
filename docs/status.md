# Status and handoff

## Milestones

| Milestone | Needs the phone | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M2** toolchain: reproducible kernel pipeline (line K0) | no | **done**: CI run [43207707172](https://github.com/Homura8/g54-xnu/actions/runs/43207707172) reproduced ruby's kernel code and data (exec-data `6b22fc25…`) without any KDK, in 10 minutes |
| **M1** device facts and safety baseline | read-only first | not started; template in [device-facts.md](device-facts.md) |
| **M3** first observable execution: LK runs our code (panel colour), then XNU's early framebuffer mark | yes, with explicit approval | not started; depends on M1 + M2 |

Success criteria for M3, borrowed from ruby's proven ladder: (1) LK accepts
the image and a tiny payload paints the panel; (2) the kernel's stage-0 band
appears; (3) kernel log on screen. Each step is RAM-booted if the G54 permits
`fastboot boot`, photographed, and tied to the image hash.

## Why this route (decided 2026-11-12)

The fastest path to both first execution and a usable iOS is the direct
LK → XNU route proven on the MediaTek MT6877 by ruby-ios-bringup (iOS 16.7.16,
same kernel lineage as ios-qemu, the owner already has the IPSW). UniXNU's
iPadOS 17 route would first need a G54 UEFI port; no MediaTek UniXNU port has
reached a home screen. UniXNU stays the fallback if the G54's LK refuses
direct kernels.

## M1 offline preflight (2026-11-12; **not a G54 hardware test**)

- Collector review found that failed Fastboot `getvar all` commands and ambiguous
  device selection could otherwise yield misleading reports. The focused
  [preflight PR](../scripts/m1_facts.py) now rejects these, checks failed/empty
  ADB `getprop`, accepts both prefixed and bare `getvar` lines, and writes
  only parsed/redacted Fastboot variables to disk (not unparsed raw lines).
- A [read-only first-session runbook](first-session.md) documents the Mac
  commands, privacy review, and stop points. No phone, kernel or Apple asset
  was accessed during this work.
- Motorola confirms the G54 launched with Android 13/Dimensity 7020. The
  community `cancunf` BoardConfig targets boot header v4, 4 KiB pages and
  `vendor_boot`; stock header, DTB placement and `init_boot` on this unit
  remain **unobserved**. Do not infer phone-specific values from that tree.
- **Potential M3 blocker:** a G54-specific report says `fastboot boot` is not
  implemented. RAM-only boot is unverified; do not plan any writable alternative
  without a matching stock recovery path and separate owner approval.
- The manufacturer Software Fix recovery flow requires a Windows PC and can
  erase personal data; do not assume a Mac-only restore route.
- No general Celestia Nexus change is required: these are G54-specific
  preflight constraints. M1 remains incomplete until actual phone evidence.

## Next concrete steps

1. M1 read-only facts (owner, with the phone): run `scripts/m1_facts.py adb`,
   then `fastboot`, and the offline `bootimg` analysis on the matching stock
   images; fill device-facts.md. This is now the critical path; nothing
   device-specific can be written before it.
2. Boot-image format work once the header version and DTB location are known
   (ruby's `tools/image` covers header v2 only).
3. First G54 patch: the early framebuffer address/stride from M1, with the
   exec-data gate switched to record-only.

## K0 evidence (2026-11-12)

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Runner | `macos-15` image `20261104.0514.1`, macOS 15.8.2 (24H232) |
| Xcode | 16.0, build 16A242d (checked by the workflow) |
| KDK | none preinstalled; `KDKROOT` = empty directory, still empty after the build; no download |
| Patchsets | ruby `a9cc0050…` and G54 `a9cc0050…` (187 files) |
| Kernel | exec-data `6b22fc25…` = ruby CI 42301546006; `__TEXT`, `__CTF`, `__LINKEDIT` differ (build paths), all code and data segments identical |
| Time | 10 min with a cold ccache |
