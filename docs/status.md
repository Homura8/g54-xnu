# Status and handoff

## Milestones

| Milestone | Needs the phone | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M2** toolchain: reproducible kernel pipeline (line K0) | no | **done**: CI run [43207707172](https://github.com/Homura8/g54-xnu/actions/runs/43207707172) reproduced ruby's kernel code and data (exec-data `6b22fc25…`) without any KDK, in 10 minutes |
| **M1** device facts and safety baseline | read-only first | **done for 5-8-6** (2026-11-12 UTC): post-OTA firmware, slot, AVB chain, LK framebuffer/watchdog sources and a cryptographically matched stock `boot.img` recorded in [device-facts.md](device-facts.md) |
| **M3** first observable execution: LK runs our code (panel colour), then XNU's early framebuffer mark | yes, controlled experiment | **E0 done** ([`fastboot boot` is a no-op](experiments/2026-11-12-e0-fastboot-boot.md)); G1 probe built, emulated, packed and verified; **E1 (flash probe to `boot_a`, restore stock) prepared, awaiting owner go-ahead** |

Success criteria for M3, borrowed from ruby's proven ladder: (1) LK accepts
the image and a tiny payload paints the panel; (2) the kernel's stage-0 band
appears; (3) kernel log on screen. RAM boot is **not** available (E0), so each
step flashes `boot_a` and restores the verified stock 5-8-6 `boot.img`
(SHA-256 `e0fe4010…`) afterwards. Link each observed milestone to an image hash.

## Why this route (decided 2026-11-12)

The fastest path to both first execution and a usable iOS is the direct
LK → XNU route proven on the MediaTek MT6877 by ruby-ios-bringup (iOS 16.7.16,
same kernel lineage as ios-qemu, the owner already has the IPSW). UniXNU's
iPadOS 17 route would first need a G54 UEFI port; no MediaTek UniXNU port has
reached a home screen. UniXNU stays the fallback if the G54's LK refuses
direct kernels.

## M1 offline preflight (2026-11-12; **not a G54 hardware test**)

- Collector review found that failed Fastboot `getvar all` commands and ambiguous
  device selection could otherwise yield misleading reports. The focused
  [hardened collector](../scripts/m1_facts.py) now rejects these, checks failed/empty
  ADB `getprop`, accepts both prefixed and bare `getvar` lines, and writes
  only parsed/redacted Fastboot variables to disk (not unparsed raw lines).
- A [read-only first-session runbook](first-session.md) documents the Mac
  commands, privacy review, and stop points. No phone, kernel or Apple asset
  was accessed during this work.
- Motorola confirms the G54 launched with Android 13/Dimensity 7020. The
  community `cancunf` BoardConfig targets boot header v4, 4 KiB pages and
  `vendor_boot`; stock header, DTB placement and `init_boot` on this unit
  remain **unobserved**. Do not infer phone-specific values from that tree.
- **Potential M3 blocker:** a G54-specific report says `fastboot boot` is not
  implemented. RAM-only boot is unverified; do not plan any writable alternative
  without a matching stock recovery path and separate owner approval.
- The manufacturer Software Fix recovery flow requires a Windows PC and can
  erase personal data; do not assume a Mac-only restore route.
- No general Celestia Nexus change is required: these are G54-specific
  preflight constraints. **After** this offline work, the owner successfully
  collected M1 ADB and Fastboot hardware facts; firmware-image and recovery
  verification remain outstanding. See the checkpoint below.

## Next concrete steps (12 November 2026 UTC, after the 5-8-6 OTA)

1. **E1, G1 probe on hardware** (needs the owner's explicit go-ahead to write
   `boot_a`). Preflight gates all passed at 15:56 UTC: build = package,
   slot A, unlocked, `snapshot-update-status=none`, `boot_a` = 64 MiB = image
   size, restore image hash checked. Procedure: `fastboot flash boot_a
   out/g1/probe-boot.img`, `fastboot reboot`, then time Fastboot's return
   (expect ~15 s plus two LK boots, `reason: preloader set fastboot mode`;
   immediate return = LK rejection). Restore with `fastboot flash boot_a
   <package boot.img>` and confirm Android plus `ro.boot.vbmeta.digest`. If
   the phone cycles colours for over a minute, hold Power + Volume Down.
2. **G2, XNU stage-0 band on the G54.** Reuse the pinned ios-topaz `shim/`,
   `tools/mkadt.py` and `tools/mkpayload.py` (ruby's lineage; source at
   `BASE_SHA`). G54 deltas: MT6855 GIC/timer/CPU map in the ADT (the A55
   cores `cpu@000`–`cpu@005`, as ruby uses only A55), LK framebuffer from
   `/chosen atag,videolfb-*`, watchdog `0x1c007000`. Pack shim+payload with
   `scripts/g54_payload.py`; the stock gzip stream is 19,694,685 bytes (raw
   46,925,524). Reuse the K0 kernel; no XNU rebuild is needed for G2.
3. Then storage (UFS LUN/partition for the iOS root), then launchd, then
   SpringBoard, following ruby's ladder; change one subsystem per image.

### Safety notes learned this session

- `fastboot boot` answers `OKAY` without booting. Never read that as success.
- LK's `set_active` warns that the target slot's bootloader images may be
  invalid (brick risk), and slot B still holds 5-8-4. Do not switch slots.
- Never run the package's `flashfile.xml` wholesale: it flashes preloader, LK,
  TEE, GPT and efuseBackup, and erases `nvdata`.
- Wait for the post-OTA Virtual A/B merge (`snapshot-update-status=none`, no
  `*-cow` mapper devices; merge starts 300 s after boot) before any write.

## Observed G54 hardware checkpoint (2026-11-12 UTC)

- ADB `facts/20261112T143123Z-adb`: XT2343-2 (later read-only
  `ro.boot.hardware.sku`), `cancunf`, MT6855V/AZA, Cortex-A55/A78,
  Android 15, first API 33, `retapac`, software
  `V1TDS35H.83-20-5-8-3`, slot `_a`, AVB `orange`, lock flag `0`.
  `vendor_boot`, `dtbo`, `lk` present; no `init_boot` observed;
  `/sys/class/graphics/fb0` absent.
- Fastboot `facts/20261112T143344Z-fastboot`: `product=cancunf`,
  `securestate=flashing_unlocked`, `is-userspace=no`,
  `current-slot=a`, `slot-count=2`,
  `max-download-size=268435456`. These data do **not** establish
  partition sizes or `fastboot boot` support.
- Bootloader property: `MBM-3.1-cancunf_g_vext-31a87-V1TDS35H.83-20-5-8-3-6e233`.
  The downloaded `...5-8-6` package is a distinct version; no firmware
  images have yet been verified in this repository.
- Do not publish raw `facts/` reports or the device serial. No custom
  G54 payload or XNU execution has been observed.
